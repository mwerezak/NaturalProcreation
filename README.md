# Natural Procreation

Modifies the Iron Teeth faction to use natural procreation instead of breeding pods.

This was just a personal mod, I don't expect too many people will care for it, but I figured I might as well publish it in case anyone else out there wants this.

## What it does
Technically it modifies all factions, but only the Iron Teeth will be affected. What it does is:

Removes all Dwellings that have the BreedingPod component.
Any Dwellings that don't have the ProcreationHouse component, get one added.

This mod will probably affect balance.

## Things for later
* I might add a setting to turn down the population growth % chance for the Iron Teeth to compensate.
* Or maybe undo the changes to Iron Teeth housing, and give them a special row-house sized dwelling to use for procreation that only houses 2 adults and 1 child. So you can choose between building for efficiently holding large numbers (but no breeding allowed in the shared space), or building for population growth.

* I'd like to also maybe re-add the breeding pods, but as a mid or late-game tech building instead.
